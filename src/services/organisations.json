You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on C++), and the Arduino Software (IDE or CLI tool).\r\n\r\nOver the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.\r\n\r\nArduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs.

In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\r\n\r\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others.

Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\r\n\r\nCore features\r\nNative Parallelism\r\n\r\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\r\n\r\nData and Task Locality\r\n\r\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\r\n\r\nMultiresolution Philosophy\r\n\r\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\r\n\r\nModern Language Features\r\n\r\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\r\n\r\nInteroperability\r\n\r\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.",

We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the Checker Framework.\r\n\r\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production. It is based on the idea of pluggable type-checking. Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.\r\n\r\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as int count = \"hello\";. However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's. The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool: it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program. Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use. It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow. We have created around 20 new type systems, and other people have created many more.\r\n\r\nThe Checker Framework is popular: it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small. It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code. The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature. Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne. With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project: everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration. We welcome your contribution!\r\n\r\nPlease see our ideas list for how to get started and how to ask questions.",

The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.\r\n\r\nDebian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.\r\n\r\nHowever, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.\r\n\r\nA large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.\r\n\r\nOf course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer.

Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search. DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million \"things\" of 685 different \"types\" in 125 languages, with over 3 billion \"facts\". It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications. For example, BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday. DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL).

It is also the Brazilian branch of the FrameNet initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.\r\n\r\nThe Database\r\nFN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes data about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.\r\n\r\nThe Applications\r\nFN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal web annotation tool, a domain-specific dictionary - the FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary; a system for recommending tourist attractions - m.knob; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.",

Events are a powerful way to express the logic of your game, without having to learn a programming language. In an event, you specify one or more conditions that are applied on the game objects. If they are fulfilled, actions are launched. These events are then translated to code when the game is exported or previewed.\r\n\r\nGDevelop takes visual programming to the next step, allowing to add ready-made behaviors to game objects and to make new behaviors using these intuitive, easy to learn events.\r\n\r\nAn extensible and robust game engine\r\nGDevelop has out of the box support for physics, shaders, particles, rich text, tweens, pathfinding, a platformer engine... and is bundled with 80+ examples.\r\n\r\nExtensions can be developed to enhance the game engine - all built-in features are provided by extensions. Users and developers can make extensions using JavaScript or using the visual events.\r\n\r\nThe game engine and the editors are based on WebGL and JavaScript (Pixi.js, React.js for the editor interface) and WebAssembly (some parts are implemented in C++).

Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\r\n\r\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute intractable multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in computational economics as, by exploiting approximate volume computation of convex bodies, we use it to detect financial crises and evaluate portfolios performance in large stock markets with hundreds of assets.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection. The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.\r\n\r\nMDAnalysis is a project written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, softmatter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.

The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.\r\n\r\nThe Lab\r\n\r\nThe Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 https://lab.open-roberta.org/ is online and has had more than 500 000 visits in 2019 across more than 120 countries.\r\n\r\nThe backend is written in Java.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide that raises all ships.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments.

The main objective of the project, called ProvinciaWiFi (later renamed WiFi Metropolitano), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing digital divide by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium CASPUR (later merged in the CINECA consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the CINECA consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.\r\n\r\nThe software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 network management system and different NetJSON implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.",

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.\r\n\r\nInteractive learning\r\nOppia teaches content in small units called explorations. Learners (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.\r\n\r\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\r\n\r\nCommunity-driven lesson creation\r\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of creators (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.\r\n\r\nCome join us!\r\nOppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!",

We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.\r\n\r\nSince a Kickstarter in mid-2017, key members of our community have built a web app that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, now in beta-testing, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The web-app repository has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. While users enjoy the live “concert” they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas’ ability to communicate & echolocate scarce salmon.\r\n\r\nOrcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery:\r\n\r\norcanode holds Python code and shell scripts that generate the live audio stream in lossy HLS or DASH format to optimize audio playback within modern browsers and lossless FLAC format for scientific analysis.\r\norcadata houses multiple team efforts to develop machine learning algorithms and data processing tools for bioacoustics and underwater noise pollution.\r\norcabooth shares Orcasound recordings with educational/outreach organizations.\r\norcamap visualizes acoustic detection and classification data spatially.",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.\r\n\r\nIt is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.\r\n\r\nEcosystem\r\nPitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.\r\n\r\nThe pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.\r\n\r\nIn addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.\r\n\r\nTooling\r\nThe many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.",

We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\r\n\r\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software.

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.\r\n\r\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\r\n\r\nFor GSoC 2020, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).\r\n\r\n",

Many individuals & organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.\r\n\r\nTools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\r\n\r\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\r\n\r\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members",

JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2020 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Humboldt University - Germany, and Charles University - Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\r\n\r\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published. ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.30 in September 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the Overview/Statistics page), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (Google Groups forum) of over 9000 members as of January 2020, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 250 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide.

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\r\n\r\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\r\n\r\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\r\n\r\nUsed at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\r\n\r\nCommunity Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling",

      "long_description": "Why syslog-ng?\r\nWith syslog-ng, you can collect logs from wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.\r\n\r\nsyslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.\r\n\r\nBy integrating with big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to kafka and elasticsearch, even store logs in hdfs.\r\n\r\nSupport for common inputs\r\n\r\nsyslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.\r\n\r\nFlexible data extraction\r\n\r\nWorking with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\r\n\r\nSimplify complex log data\r\n\r\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\r\n\r\nDatabases destinations\r\n\r\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.\r\n\r\nMessage queue support\r\n\r\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nHTTP/REST support\r\n\r\nsyslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively\r\n\r\nSupport language bindings\r\n\r\nWant to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

We distribute these tools freely and encourage our users to appropriate them, taking ownership and responsibility for their learning.\r\n\r\nSugar is both a desktop and a collection of Activities. Activities, as the name implies, are Apps that involve active engagement from the learner. Activities automatically save results to a journal, where reflections are recorded. Activity instances can be shared between learners; many support real-time collaboration.\r\n\r\nSugar facilitates sharing and collaboration: Children can write, share books, or make music together with a single mouse-click.\r\nActivities, not applications: Sugar activities are applicable beyond the scope of the classroom and even Sugar itself.\r\nAutomatic backup of Activity work; no worrying about files or folders. Sugar’s Journal makes it almost impossible to lose any data.\r\nThe Sugar Journal records everything you do: It is a place to reflect upon and evaluate your work.\r\nSugar runs on most computer hardware, including slower machines.\r\nSugar is Free (Libre) Software: It is written in the Python language and easily customized.\r\nSugar is documented by its users: It is easy to use and teachers worldwide have created a wealth of pedagogical materials for it.\r\nSugar is largely written and maintained by its users.\r\nSugarizer is a fork of Sugar available for tablets and phones.\r\nTurtle Blocks and Music Blocks are popular programming Apps that run in Sugar, Sugarizer, or stand-alone on the GNU/Linux desktop or in a browser",
